        This script tag will load your compiled React application.
        In a typical React project (e.g., created with Vite or Create React App),
        your TSX files are compiled into a JavaScript bundle (like main.js or index.js)
        and placed in a 'dist' or 'build' folder.
        You'll need to adjust the path below to match your build output.
    -->
    <script type="module" src="App.tsx"></script>
    <!--
        Note: For a real build, this path would typically be something like:
        <script type="module" src="/assets/index-xxxxxxxx.js"></script> (for Vite)
        or
        <script src="/static/js/main.js"></script> (for Create React App)
        For this example, we're pointing directly to main.tsx for demonstration purposes
        in a local development setup, but a build step is crucial for GitHub Pages.
